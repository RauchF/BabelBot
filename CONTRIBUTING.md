# Contributing to BabelBot

Thank you for taking the time and interest to help out and make this software better!

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainer at babelbot@kaputty.de.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. **Note: Tests are yet to be implemented, volunteers needed!**
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. **Note: Documentation is yet to be written, volunteers needed!**
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints. **Note: Linting is yet to be added, volunteers needed!**
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/RauchF/BabelBot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/RauchF/BabelBot/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408) for a great bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This project does not yet have a clearly defined style. Try to keep the same style going as the existing code base uses.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
